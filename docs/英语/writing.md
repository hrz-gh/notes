### 举小例子

 抽象名词或复数名词，可跟 such as 来加小例子

I love reading masterpieces such as Gone with the Wind, Pride and Prejudice and Little Prince.

### 举大例子

Although multitudes of cases can support my simple view, the following one is most favorable.

I, the other day, had a high fever because it rained heavily last night.  Unfortunately, no families or roommates took care of me during the holiday. At that moment, a dormitory assistant entered to give me some medicines. Then, I recovered the next day. So the story vividly tells us a truth that loving heart seems like a lamp which will become lighter in darkness.

为什么年龄大满意度高? 

Although a sea of cases can clarify my perspective, the following one may be the most typical. I have an uncle who had worked as a teacher in a middle school. When he was about 40 years old, he appeared exceedingly upset almost every day, with a blank face in his class. However, now he has retired and gone to university for the elderly. Every time he comes to my house could find happiness in his eyes. What a pleasant matter. So the story tells us that the elder human beings become, the more delighted they lead their life.
